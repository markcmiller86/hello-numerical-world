# Hello Numerical World
![example workflow](https://github.com/Josee1031/hello-numerical-world/.github/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

For a complete, hands-on lesson involving this simple HPC/CSE application, please see the [ATPESC-2020 hands on lesson](lessons/hand_coded_heat/).

This is an implementation of an application for solving one dimensional heat conduction
problems. It is the functional equivalent of a *Hello World* application for HPC/CSE.

In general, heat [conduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conduction) is governed
by the partial differential equation ([PDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation))...

where _u_ is the temperature at spatial positions, _x_, and times, _t_,
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Calpha) is the _thermal diffusivity_
of the material through which heat is flowing. This PDE
is known as the _Diffusion Equation_ and also the [_Heat Equation_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation).

### Simplifying Assumptions

Our implemenation makes some simplifying assumptions...

1. The thermal diffusivity, ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Calpha),
   is constant for all _space_ and _time_.
1. The only heat _source_ is from the initial and/or boundary conditions.
1. We will deal only with the _one dimensional_ problem in _Cartesian coordinates_.

In this case, the PDE simplifies to...

From this highly simplified basic problem, there are a number of [extensions](http://hplgit.github.io/num-methods-for-PDEs/doc/pub/diffu/html/._diffu001.html) available for a more in-depth computational science study.

Currently, three different numerical algorithms are implemented here

* [Foward Time Centered Space (FTCS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTCS_scheme), an
[explicit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_and_implicit_methods) method
* [Crank-Nicholson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crankâ€“Nicolson_method),
an [implicit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_and_implicit_methods) method
* [Dufort-Frankel](http://folk.ntnu.no/leifh/teaching/tkt4140/._main064.html#ch5:sec42), another
[explicit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_and_implicit_methods) method
with higher temporal order than FTCS.

In addition, the application can be built with half, single, double and long-double precision.

Details are described more fully in this [ATPESC](https://extremecomputingtraining.anl.gov)

### Compiling and Using

The command...

```
make
```

will output help about available make targets.

```
Targets:
    heat: makes the default heat application (double precision)
    heat-omp: makes heat with OpenMP parallel threading (double precision)
    heat-half: makes the heat application with half precision
    heat-single: makes the heat application with single precision
    heat-double: makes the heat application with double precision
    heat-long-double: makes the heat application with long-double precision
    PTOOL=[gnuplot,matplotlib,visit] RUNAME=<run-dir-name> plot: plots results
    check: runs various tests confirming steady-state is linear

```

`make heat` will make the heat application with *default* (double) precision.
After making the application, the command...

```
./heat --help
```

gives help and example command-line argument usage...

```

```

### Plotting results

There are scripts for running [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) and [VisIt](https://visit.llnl.gov) to produce curve plots of the results.
Whatever option you select, the associated tool must be in your path.
For example, to use `gnuplot`, use the command...

```
   make PTOOL=gnuplot RUNAME=heat_results plot
```

Where the `RUNAME` option is the name of the directory/folder containing the results to be plotted.

### Setting the Initial Condition (`ic=`)

The initial condition argument, `ic=`, handles various cases...
    
* **Constant**, `ic="const(V)"`: Set initial condition to constant value, `V`
* **Ramp**, `ic="ramp(L,R)"`: Set initial condition to a linear ramp having value `L` @ `x=0` and `R` @ `x=L_x`.
* **Step**, `ic="step(L,Mx,R)"`: Set initial condition to a step function having value `L` for all `x<Mx` and value `R` for all `x>=Mx`.
* **Random**, `ic="rand(S,B,A)"`: Set initial condition to random values in the range `[B-A,B+A]` using seed value `S`.
* **Sin**, `ic="sin(A,w)"`: Set initial condition to `A*sin(pi*w*x)`.   
* **Spikes**, `ic="spikes(C,A0,X0,A1,X1,...)"`: Set initial condition to a constant value, `C` with any number of _spikes_ where each spike is the pair, `Ai` specifying the spike amplitude and `Xi` specifying its position in, `x`.
* **File**, `ic="file(foo.dat)"` : read initial condition data from the file `foo.dat`.


**Note**: The boundary condition arguments, `bc0=` and `bc1=` should be specified such that they *combine* smoothly with the specified initial condition.
