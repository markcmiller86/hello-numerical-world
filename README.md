# Hello Numerical World

**NOTE:** This repository is imported from [here](https://github.com/markcmiller86/hello-numerical-world.git)

In this repo is a very simple implementation of an application for solving the one dimensional
heat conduction equation. This is the functional equivalent of a *Hello World* application for
HPC/CSE numerical software developers.

In general, heat [conduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conduction) is governed
by the partial differential (PDE)...

where _u_ is the temperature at spatial positions, _x_, and times, _t_,
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Calpha) is the _thermal diffusivity_
of the homogeneous material through which heat is flowing. This partial differential equation (PDE)
is known as the _Diffusion Equation_ and also the [_Heat Equation_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation).

### Simplifying Assumptions

To make the problem tractable for this lesson, we make some simplifying assumptions...

1. The thermal diffusivity, ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Calpha),
   is constant for all _space_ and _time_.
1. The only heat _source_ is from the initial and/or boundary conditions.
1. We will deal only with the _one dimensional_ problem in _Cartesian coordinates_.

In this case, the PDE our application needs to solve simplifies to...

Currently, three different numerical algorithms are implemented

* [Foward Time Centered Space (FTCS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTCS_scheme), an
[explicit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_and_implicit_methods) method
* [Crank-Nicholson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crankâ€“Nicolson_method),
an [implicit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_and_implicit_methods) method
* [Upwind-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upwind_scheme), another
[explicit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_and_implicit_methods) method
with higher spatial order than FTCS.
